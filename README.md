CNN used with 3 convolutionlayers and in between always a maxpooling. Afterwards two fully connected dense layers.
Trained with roughly 8% of the availabile data. Further improvements could be done to the CNN, the amount used for training and the implemetation to speed up the process.

Achieved test accuracy: 97.64%
